# 01-Introduction



I used the rubric and sample code lines to answer a series of questions that will better help you understand me, my game preferences, concerns, and outlook on the class. I have also linked my stackoverflow.com user number and the URL to my github.com profile. To be able to have every line sync perfectly while also having 13 lines (for the 13 stripes) I had to really plan out what I wanted to type, and to get a decent looking flag size I had to add some extra tidbits about me, so enjoy! (P.S. for the sake of creating a flush and straight flag the end of each sentence is marked with an exclamation point, but I can assure you I am not yelling.)
